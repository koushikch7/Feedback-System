<br>
<article>
        Gathering information from you about your experience as learners in your class is a valuable way to assess teaching. There are many ways of collecting feedback: Small Group Instructional Diagnoses (SGIDs), Surveys, WebQs and open-ended feedback forms. BITM Students Team-CHK are introducing the online feedback system to assess various parameters like quality of teaching, infrastructure made available and other amenities provided to you. <b>This feedback will not disclose any individual details like your USN, Year of Study / Semester and personal details , to either the BITM faculty or stakeholders.</b> All types of assessment are based on the principle that the more you understand how students are learning, how the faculty is teaching and to improve more effective methods of teaching at BITM in coming days.
